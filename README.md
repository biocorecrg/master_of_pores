# Nanopore analysis pipeline
Nextflow pipeline for analysis of Nanopore data from direct RNA sequencing. This is a joint project between [CRG bioinformatics core](https://biocore.crg.eu/) and [Epitranscriptomics and RNA Dynamics research group](https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/novoa-lab).  
The current version is the 1.1. The original 1.0 published in the paper is [here](https://github.com/biocorecrg/master_of_pores/releases/tag/v1.0)

-------------------------------------
## New DSL2 version of Master Of Pores is out as beta!!
We translated nanopreprocess and nanotail using DSL2. Soon we will port nanomod and introduce novel pipelines!
