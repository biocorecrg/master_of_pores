# NanoMod
This module allows to predict the loci with RNA modifications starting from data produced by NanoPreprocess.

## Workflow

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocorecrg/master_of_pores/master/docs/dag_mod_2.png" width="600" align="middle">


* **index_reference** index the reference file for Epinano
* **call_variants** uses Samtools for calling the variants for Epinano
* **calc_var_frequencies** it uses TSV_to_Variants_Freq.py3 for calculating the frequencies of each variants for Epinano
* **predict_with_EPInano** It predicts the modifications with Epinano in parallel splitting the input file in 1 million rows
* **combineEpinanoPred** It combine the results from Epinano 
* **resquiggling** resquiggle fast5 files for Tombo
* **getModifications** it estimates the modifications using Tombo comparing WT vs KO

## Input Parameters
1. **input_path** path to the folders produced by NanoPreprocessing step.
1. **comparison** tab separated text file containing the list of comparison. Here an example:
```bash
WT1 KO1
WT2 KO2
WT3 KO3
```
1. **reference** reference transcriptome
1. **output** folder
1. **coverage** read coverage threshold for prediction
1. **tombo_opt** options for tombo
1. **epinano_opt** options for epinano
1. **email**

## Results
Three folders are produced by this module:

1. Epinano, containing the results obtained with this method. You have a single file with putative modifications.

2. Tombo, containing the results obtained with this method in fasta format. You have one file for each comparison WT vs KO
